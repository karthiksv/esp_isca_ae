This directory contains a python-based implementation of the analytical scaling model described in the paper's section V.E

The method to determine the scaling coefficients was desribed in the paper's section VI.D and executing the code tokenpm_projections.py generates and plots the data shown in figure 21.

Runtime is in the order of a couple of seconds, the two subplots are displayed sequentially.

The plotted data can be compared to the one diplayed in the paper on figure 21 and is expected to match identically, as based on the same anaytical model.
